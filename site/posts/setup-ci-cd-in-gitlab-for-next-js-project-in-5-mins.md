## Introduction

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are crucial aspects of modern software development practices. In order to achieve faster and more efficient development cycles, it is important to implement automated testing, building, and deployment workflows. GitLab CI/CD is a powerful tool that enables developers to easily set up such workflows for their projects. In this article, we will explore how to set up GitLab CI/CD for a Next.js project.
<br/>
<br/>

## Prequistes
Before we get started with setting up GitLab CI/CD, there are a few prerequisites that you will need:

- [x] A GitLab account
- [x] A Next.js project with a Git repository
- [x] A GitLab runner (either a shared runner provided by GitLab or a dedicated runner on your own infrastructure)

<br/>
<br/>

## Setting up the GitLab CI/CD pipeline

The first step in setting up GitLab CI/CD for your Next.js project is to create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the configuration for your CI/CD pipeline.

<br/>

The basic structure of a .gitlab-ci.yml file looks like this:

<pre>
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npm run build

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy

</pre>

The stages section defines the different stages of your pipeline, and the jobs section defines the individual jobs that make up each stage.

<br/>

In this example, we have three stages: build, test, and deploy. The build stage runs npm ci and npm run build to build your Next.js project. The test stage runs npm run test to execute your test suite. The deploy stage runs npm run deploy to deploy your application.

<br/>

Note that the npm ci command is used instead of npm install to ensure that the exact versions of your dependencies are installed, rather than potentially different versions due to caching.

<br/>

Once you have created your .gitlab-ci.yml file, commit and push it to your Git repository.

<br/>
<br/>

## Setting up GitLab runner

Next, you will need to set up a GitLab runner to execute your CI/CD pipeline.

<br/>

GitLab runners are processes that run on your infrastructure and execute the jobs defined in your .gitlab-ci.yml file. There are two types of runners: shared runners provided by GitLab, and dedicated runners that you can set up on your own infrastructure.

<br/>

Shared runners are typically sufficient for small to medium-sized projects, but for larger projects with more complex pipelines, a dedicated runner may be required.

<br/>

To set up a shared runner, navigate to your GitLab project's settings page, and click on the "CI/CD" tab. From there, click on "Runners", and then click on "Set up a shared runner". Follow the instructions to install and register the runner on your machine.

<br/>

Alternatively, to set up a dedicated runner, follow the instructions in the GitLab documentation.

<br/>

Once you have set up your runner, it will automatically start executing the jobs defined in your .gitlab-ci.yml file whenever you push changes to your Git repository.

<br/>
<br/>

## Monitoring your pipeline

Once your pipeline is up and running, you can monitor its progress and view the logs of each job in the GitLab UI. You can also configure notifications to alert you when your pipeline fails or succeeds.
